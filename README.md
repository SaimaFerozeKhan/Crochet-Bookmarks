# Crochet-Bookmarks
Crochet bookmarks are handmade, decorative pieces used to mark pages in a book, crafted using various crochet techniques. These bookmarks come in many designs, from simple to intricate, and are typically thin and lightweight to easily slip between the pages without damaging the book.
